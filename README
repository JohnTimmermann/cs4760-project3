How to compile the project:
Type ’make’
Example of how to run the project:
./oss -n 12 -s 5 -t 3 -i 0.5

Generative AI used : Gemin 2.5 Pro
Prompts:
    - How do I handle creating shared memory that can be used by two different processes?  
    - What is the best way to handle signals (like ctrl+c) in c++ in a linux environment?
    - Do you see any errors with my code
    - Does my code meet the standards outlined in the document

Summary: I needed some help with the the syntax and logic for handling shared memory and signals
as I am not as familiar with these things. I also used it quite a lot for error checking my code
to highlight some of the areas where my logic was incorrect. Finally I usually run all my code
through AI as a double check pointing out any issues based on a certain criteria to make sure I am
not missing anything critical.

It was very useful for helping me understand how I could implement shared memory between two processes
especially by using a shared header file.
